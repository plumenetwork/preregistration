            <br />
            <br />
            <b>1.1 Terms:</b> These Airdrop Terms and Conditions govern the
            participation and receipt of tokens through the airdrop program
            (“Airdrop”) organized by the Plume Foundation, a Cayman Islands
            foundation company, and its subsidiaries (“we,” “us,” or “our”).
            These Airdrop Terms and Conditions are supplemental to, and
            incorporate by reference, our general Terms of Service available at
            <a
              href="https://docs.plumenetwork.xyz/plume/community-and-support/terms-of-service"

            </a>{" "}
            (the Airdrop Terms and Condition and general Terms of Service
            together, the “Terms”). Defined terms used but not defined herein
            have the meaning set forth in the general Terms of Service. The
            Airdrop, and your participation in it, is a Service as defined under
            the general Terms of Service.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>1.2 Agreement:</b> By participating in the Airdrop, you
            acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by
            these Terms. These Terms govern your ability to participate in the
            Airdrop. Please read these Terms carefully, as they include
            important information about your legal rights. By participating in
            the Airdrop, you are agreeing to these Terms. If you do not
            understand or agree to these Terms, please do not participate in the
            Airdrop.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>1.3 Transitive Agreement:</b> If you are participating in the
            Airdrop on behalf of an entity or other organization, you are
            agreeing to these Terms for that entity or organization and
            representing to us that you have the authority to bind that entity
            or organization to these Terms (and, in which case, the terms “you”
            and “your” will refer to that entity or organization).
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>1.4 Term Modification:</b> We reserve the right, at our sole
            discretion, to change or modify any portion of these Terms at any
            time. If we do this, we will publicly post the updated Terms on our
            website and will indicate at the top of this page the date these
            Terms were last updated. Your continued use of our Services from and
            after the date any such changes become effective constitutes your
            acceptance of the new Terms. If you do not agree to abide by these
            or any future Terms, you will not access, browse, or use (or
            continue to access, browse, or use) our Airdrop website or Services.
            Without limiting anything set forth elsewhere in these Terms, you
            agree that we shall not be liable to you or any third party as a
            result of any losses suffered by any modification or amendment of
            this Agreement.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>2. Eligibility</b>
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>2.1 Sole Discretion.</b> We, in our sole discretion, shall
            determine the eligibility criteria for participation in the Airdrop,
            including the amount of Tokens to be distributed to eligible
            Participants that satisfy certain criteria. Different eligible
            Participants may receive different amounts of Tokens in any
            particular Airdrop, depending on the criteria set forth by us for
            such Airdrop (“Airdrop Tokens”). We shall have no obligation to
            notify actual or potential Airdrop participants of the eligibility
            criteria for any Airdrop prior to, during, or after the claims are
            opened for such Airdrop.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>2.2 Disqualification.</b> We reserve the sole and absolute right
            to disqualify any participant or potential participant we deem
            ineligible for an Airdrop (be it under these Terms or by having
            determined the participant engaged in any conduct that we consider
            harmful, unlawful, inappropriate, or unacceptable). Such
            disqualification may be appropriate if we determine, in our sole
            discretion, for example, that the participant may have used multiple
            addresses to obscure its identity or location or to attempt to game,
            cheat, or hack the Airdrop or Tokens.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>2.3 Age Requirement:</b> You must have full legal capacity and
            authority to bind and agree to the Terms. You must be at least the
            age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence (or have reached
            the age of legal capacity) to participate.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>2.4 Jurisdictional Restrictions:</b> You are solely responsible
            for understanding and complying with any and all laws and
            regulations applicable to your participation in the Airdrop in your
            jurisdiction. You agree and acknowledge that you are responsible for
            complying with all applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which you
            reside or in which you are participating in the Airdrop. You agree
            and acknowledge that we reserve the right to require additional
            information from you and to enter, use, or share such information
            into or with a Screening Service Provider (defined below), and its
            systems, tools, or functionalities, as we deem appropriate in our
            sole discretion, including to reduce the risks of money laundering,
            terrorist financing, sanctions violations, or other potentially
            illicit activity, or as otherwise necessary to address laws and
            regulations that may be relevant to the Airdrop or the Tokens. You
            agree to provide complete and accurate information in response to
            any such requests.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>2.5 Residency Restrictions:</b> As set forth below, certain
            jurisdictions may prohibit or otherwise restrict participation in
            airdrops. You represent and warrant that you are not located in or a
            resident of any jurisdiction in which participation is restricted.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>2.6 High Risk Wallet Restrictions:</b> We have implemented a
            risk-based program applicable to the Airdrop. This program screens
            wallets attempting to participate in the Airdrop using data and
            tools provided by an independent blockchain analytics provider
            (“Screening Service Provider”) and applying screening criteria that
            may extend beyond the requirements of applicable law. Participants
            also are subject to geo-location and proxy detection controls to
            prevent access to our website by users that may be Prohibited
            Persons or located in a Prohibited Jurisdiction (as defined herein).
            We reserve the right to take any additional steps as we deem
            necessary or appropriate, in our sole discretion, to verify the
            identity and eligibility of any person. We may deny, in our sole
            discretion, any person, internet-protocol address (“IP Address”),
            and/or Ethereum or similar digital-asset, smart-contract, or
            protocol address (“Airdrop Address”) from participating in the
            Airdrop based on data from the Organization’s Screening Service
            Provider when such data indicates such person, IP Address, or
            Airdrop Address may present heightened risks based on our risk
            assessment framework.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>2.7 Agreement to Restrictions:</b> By using the Services and
            participating in any Airdrop, you agree and acknowledge that your
            Airdrop Address will be screened and excluded from the Airdrop
            program, at our sole discretion, if we detect threshold transactions
            between your Airdrop Address and another Ethereum or similar
            digital-asset, smart-contract, or protocol address associated with
            certain risk-exposure categories established by our Screening
            Service Provider. You agree and acknowledge that your IP Address
            will be screened and excluded if our geo- location controls detect
            that you may be located in a (a) Sanctioned Jurisdiction; (b)
            jurisdiction subject to heightened sanctions risks identified or
            enforced by certain countries, governments, or international
            authorities; or (c) jurisdiction otherwise considered high risk with
            respect to the Airdrop or otherwise (collectively, “Prohibited
            Jurisdictions”). You agree and understand that the Prohibited
            Jurisdictions are subject to change at our sole discretion without
            notice. To avoid circumvention of our geo-location controls, we have
            implemented proxy and VPN detection and blocking controls, which are
            designed to prevent claims by any person detected to be using VPN
            and similar proxy technologies.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>3. Participation Requirements</b> <br />
            <br />
            <b>3.1 Registration:</b> You may be required to sign up using valid
            identifying information (e.g., email address, wallet address) and
            follow instructions we provide to participate in the Airdrop.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>3.2</b>
            Wallet Compatibility: You must provide a compatible digital wallet
            address capable of receiving the Tokens (a “Wallet”). We are not
            responsible for lost or misdirected Tokens due to provision of an
            incorrect wallet address and failure to provide and connect an
            eligible Wallet may result in the forfeiture of Tokens. Note, there
            may be technical limitations, delays, and/or transaction fees due or
            payable to third parties to receive and/or claim Tokens through your
            Wallet.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>3.3 Wallet Ownership.</b> You agree that you are the legal owner
            of the Wallet you identify to participate in the Airdrop and the
            Services and will not sell, assign, or transfer control of such
            address or the Tokens to third parties to circumvent any Lock-Up (as
            defined herein) or to knowingly redistribute Tokens to a person that
            would violate these Terms if claimed directly by such person. <br />
            <br />
            <b>3.4 Wallet Disclaimers:</b> YOU AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR
            PARTICIPATION IN THE AIRDROP IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. By using a Wallet,
            you agree that you are using the Wallet in accordance with any terms
            and conditions of the applicable third-party provider of such
            Wallets. When you interact with the Airdrop you retain control over
            your digital assets at all times. We do not control digital assets,
            including the Tokens in your wallet, and we accept no responsibility
            or liability to you in connection with your use of a Wallet. We make
            no representations or warranties regarding how the Airdrop will
            operate with, or be compatible with, any specific Wallet. The
            private keys necessary to access and/or transfer the digital assets
            held in a Wallet are not known or held by us. Any third party that
            may gain access to a participant’s login credentials, private key,
            or third-party cloud or storage mechanism for such information may
            be able to misappropriate Tokens and/or other digital assets held by
            the participant. We have no ability to help you access or recover
            your private key and/or seed phrase for your wallet. You are solely
            responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your private key,
            and solely you are responsible for any transaction signed with your
            private key. We are not responsible for any loss associated with
            your private key, digital wallet, vault, or other storage mechanism.
            You agree and acknowledge that claiming the Airdrop may require
            interaction with, reliance on, or an integration with third-party
            products or services (e.g., a wallet, network, or blockchain) that
            we do not control. In the event that you are unable to access such
            products, services, or integrations, or if they fail for any reason,
            and you are unable to participate in the Airdrop or claim Tokens as
            a result, you will have no recourse or claim against us, and we do
            not bear any responsibility or liability to you. You agree and
            acknowledge that if you are unable to claim the Airdrop due to
            technical bugs, smart contract issues, gas fees, wallet
            incompatibilities, loss of access to a wallet or the key thereto, or
            for any other reason, you will have no recourse or claim against us
            and, in any such case, we shall bear no liability.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>3.5 Agreement to Lock-Up:</b> Airdrop Tokens will be subject to a
            period of transfer restrictions (the “Lock-Up”), which may be
            enforced programmatically. You agree to abide by the Lock-Up and
            further agree that we may modify or extend the Lock-Up in our sole
            and absolute discretion.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>4. Distribution of Tokens</b> <br />
            <br />
            <b>4.1 Timing:</b> We will distribute Tokens to participants who
            meet all eligibility and participation requirements at our
            discretion. <br />
            <br />
            <b>4.2 Token Allocation:</b> The number of Tokens you receive
            through the Airdrop may be limited or subject to change at our
            discretion. We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Airdrop
            at any time without prior notice. <br />
            <br />
            <b>4.3 No Guarantee:</b> While we intend to distribute Tokens, we do
            not guarantee any particular value, utility, or ongoing right
            associated with the Tokens. <br />
            <br />
            <b>5. Representations and Warranties</b> <br />
            <br />
            <b>5.1 Your Representations:</b> You represent and warrant that (a)
            you are eligible to participate in the Airdrop under these Terms and
            applicable law; (b) the wallet address you provide is under your
            sole and absolute control; (c) all information you provide is true,
            accurate, complete, and not misleading; (d) you understand that the
            Tokens may carry financial, legal, or tax implications in your

            you should consult a tax advisor with respect to the tax treatment

            other tool to circumvent any geoblock or other restrictions we may
            have implemented for Airdrop recipients and recognize that any such
            circumvention, or attempted circumvention, may permanently
            disqualify you from participation in the Airdrop in our sole
            discretion; <br />
            <br />
            <b>5.2 Not a Prohibited Person.</b> You represent, warrant, agree,
            and acknowledge that (a) the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the
            United States Treasury Department does not list you as a specially
            designated national and/or blocked person; (b) the Bureau of
            Industry and Security of the United States Department of Commerce
            does not list you on its denied persons list or lists of parties of
            concern; (c) neither you, the country you are located in, or persons
            connected to you, are on any similar list promulgated by an official
            agency or department of the United States government, the United
            Nations Security Council, the European Union, or the United
            Kingdom’s Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation; (d) you are
            not the subject of sanctions administered or enforced by the United
            States (including without limitation the U.S. Department of the
            Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control), the United Kingdom, the
            European Union, or any other governmental authority; and (e) you are
            not organized in or resident of a country or territory that is the
            subject of country-wide or territory-wide sanctions implemented by
            any of the foregoing. <br />
            <br />
            <b>5.3 Not from a Prohibited Jurisdiction:</b>
            Further, you represent, warrant, agree, and acknowledge that you are
            not located in, a citizen of, or a resident of any of the following

            <b>5.4 No Consideration.</b> You agree and acknowledge that your
            participation in the Airdrop and claim of Tokens does not require or
            involve any form of purchase, payment, or tangible consideration
            from or to us, nor otherwise require or involve any acceptance of
            value by us from you. You agree and acknowledge that you (a)
            lawfully may receive Tokens for free via the Airdrop (other than gas
            fees or applicable taxes, if any, that may be due to third parties);
            (b) were not promised the Tokens or any tokens (whether via the
            Airdrop or otherwise); and (c) took no action in anticipation of, or
            in reliance on, receiving the Tokens or any tokens, the occurrence
            of an Airdrop, or potential participation in any Airdrop. You agree
            and acknowledge that you are not entitled to receive any Airdrop
            Tokens and/or to participate in the Airdrop based on any
            documentation, commentary, calculators, metrics, and/or points
            systems published or otherwise made known by third parties
            monitoring activities on the Plume Testnet or Plume Protocol (or any
            of its smart contracts) or providing third-party applications or
            services relating thereto (“Third-Party Publications and Services”).
            You have no claim to Airdrop Tokens based on such Third-Party
            Publications and Services. We do not review, control, monitor, or
            confirm the accuracy of information that may be provided through
            Third-Party Publications or Services. You agree and acknowledge that
            you have not engaged, and will not engage, in any activities
            designed to obtain Airdrop Tokens, including on the basis of, or in
            reliance on, Third-Party Publications and Services. <br />
            <br />

            <br />
            <b>6. Prohibited Activities</b> The following activities are
            specifically prohibited when using this website, any of the

            enforcement authorities. <br />
            <br />
            <b>7. Limitation of Liability and Release</b> <br />
            <br /> <b>7.1 Maximum Limitation.</b> To the maximum extent
            permitted by law, neither we nor any of our affiliates, service
            providers, contractors or officers, directors and employees of the
            same (“Foundation Persons”) shall be liable for any damages arising
            out of or related to your participation in the Airdrop or your
            receipt, use, or inability to use the Tokens, including without
            limitation direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
            punitive damages, damages for loss of goodwill, use, or data or
            other intangible losses (even if we have been advised of the
            possibility of such damages), whether based on contract, tort,
            negligence, strict liability, or otherwise, resulting from: (a) the
            use or the inability to use the Airdrop; (b) the cost of procurement
            of substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data,
            information, or services purchased or obtained or messages received
            or transactions entered into through or from the Airdrop; (c)

            available through the interface or website; or (h) any other matter
            relating to the Airdrop. You further agree and acknowledge that if
            you are unable to claim the Airdrop due to technical bugs, smart
            contract issues, gas fees, wallet incompatibilities, loss of access
            to a wallet or the key thereto, or for any other reason, you will
            have no recourse or claim against us. In jurisdictions that do not
            allow certain limitations on liability, our liability shall be
            limited to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law. <br />
            <br />
            <b>7.2 Release.</b> You further expressly waive and release us and
            all Foundation Persons from any and all liability, claims, causes of
            action, or damages arising from or in any way relating to your
            participation in the Airdrop or use of the Services. <br />
            <br />
            <b>7.3 No Professional Advice or Fiduciary Duties.</b> All
            information provided on the website or through the Airdrop, or
            otherwise provided by us, is for informational purposes only and is
            not and should not be construed as professional advice. You should
            not take, or refrain from taking, any action based on any
            information contained on the website or obtained through the
            Airdrop. Before you make any financial, legal, tax, or other
            decisions with respect to the Airdrop, you should seek independent,
            professional advice from an individual who is licensed and qualified
            in the area for which such advice would be appropriate. These
            Airdrop Terms are not intended to, and do not, create or impose any
            fiduciary duties on us. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you
            acknowledge and agree that we owe no fiduciary duties or liabilities
            to you or any other party, and that to the extent any such duties or
            liabilities may exist at law or in equity, those duties and
            liabilities are hereby irrevocably disclaimed, waived, and
            eliminated. You further agree that the only duties and obligations
            that we owe you are those set out expressly in these Terms. <br />
            <br />
            <b>8. Indemnification</b> <br />
            <br /> <b>8.1</b> Without limiting any Terms, you agree that you
            shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless us, our directors,
            officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims,
            actions, proceedings, investigations, demands, suits, costs,
            damages, losses, liabilities, or expenses (including attorneys’ fees
            and costs, and fines or penalties imposed by any regulatory
            authority) incurred by, arising out of, or in connection with your
            breach of these Terms or your participation in the Airdrop. Your
            obligations under this indemnification provision will continue even
            after these Terms have expired or been terminated. <br />
            <br />
            <b>8.2</b> We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and
            control of any matter which is subject to indemnification under this
            section, and you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests
            assisting our defense of such matter. You may not settle or
            compromise any claim against subject to indemnification without our
            prior written consent. <br />
            <br />
            <b>9. Termination</b>
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>9.1</b> We may suspend or terminate your participation in the
            Airdrop if we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have
            breached these Terms or that your participation poses a risk to us
            or others. <br />
            <br /> <b>9.2</b>
            We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the Airdrop
            program at any time, for any reason, without prior notice. <br />
            <br />
            <b>10. Intellectual Property Rights:</b> You acknowledge and agree
            that, unless otherwise indicated in writing, we (or, as applicable,
            our licensor(s)) own all legal right, title, interest in, and all
            intellectual property and all elements of Tokens and the “Plume”
            protocol, or any underlying websites in connection with the
            distribution and/or usage of the Airdrop Tokens and “Plume”
            protocol, including, without limitation all art, designs, systems,
            methods, information, computer code, software, services, website
            design, “look and feel”, organization, compilation of the content,
            code, data and database, functionality, audio, video, text,
            photograph, graphics, and all other elements of the same
            (collectively, the “Content”). You acknowledge that the Content is
            protected by copyright, trade dress, patent laws, trademark laws,
            international conventions, other relevant intellectual property and
            proprietary rights, and applicable laws. All Content is the
            copyrighted property of the Foundation (or, as applicable), its
            licensor(s), and all trademarks, service marks, and trade names
            associated with Tokens and “Plume” protocol are proprietary to the
            Foundation or its licensor(s). Your receipt or use of airdropped
            Tokens and “Plume” protocol does not grant you ownership of or any
            other rights with respect to the Content. The Foundation reserves
            all rights in and to the Content that are not expressly granted to
            you in these Terms. In particular, you understand and agree that:
            (i) your usage of Tokens and “Plume” protocol does not give you any
            rights or licenses in or to the Content (including, without
            limitation, the Foundation’s copyright in and to the associated art)
            other than those expressly contained in these Terms; (ii) you do not
            have the right, except as otherwise set forth in these Terms, to
            reproduce, distribute, or otherwise commercialize any elements of
            the Content (including, without limitation, any art) without the
            Foundation’s prior written consent in each case, which consent may
            be withheld at the Foundation’s sole and absolute discretion; (iii)
            you will not apply for, register, or otherwise use or attempt to use
            any Tokens or “Plume” protocol trademarks or service marks, or any
            confusingly similar marks, anywhere in the world without the
            Foundation’s prior written consent in each case, which consent may
            be withheld at the Foundation’s and absolute discretion; and (iv)
            Tokens and “Plume” protocol may potentially include intellectual
            property elements provided by third parties that are subject to
            separate ownership and/or license terms, in which case those terms
            will govern such intellectual property rights.
            <br />
            <br /> <b>11. Risks of Participation</b> Claiming, using,
            transacting in, or holding the Plume Token involves a high degree of
            risk, including unforeseen risks that may not be included below. You
            should consult with your legal, tax, and financial advisors and
            carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below,
            together with all of the other information in these Airdrop Terms,
            before deciding whether to claim, use, transact in, or hold the
            Tokens. If any of the following risks were to occur, the Token or
            the Plume Network could be materially and adversely affected. You
            acknowledge that we are not responsible for any risks associated
            with your participation in the Airdrop or use of the Services, and
            cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience
            thereby.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>11.1 Risks inherent to blockchain based systems.</b> You
            understand the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic
            and blockchain-based systems, and that you have a working knowledge
            of the usage and intricacies of digital assets. You further
            understand that the markets for digital assets are highly volatile
            due to various factors, including adoption, speculation, technology,
            security, and regulation. You acknowledge and accept that the cost
            and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based
            systems are variable and may increase dramatically at any time. You
            further acknowledge and accept the risk that your digital assets may
            lose some or all of their value.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>11.2 Risks of Scams and frauds.</b> You understand that anyone
            can create a token, including fake versions of existing tokens and
            tokens that falsely claim to represent projects, and acknowledge and
            accept the risk that you may mistakenly trade those or other tokens.
            You further acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of these
            variables or risks, and cannot be held liable for any resulting
            losses that you experience while accessing or using the service.
            Accordingly, you understand and agree to assume full responsibility
            for all of the risks of accessing and using the Services. The only
            website for registering and participating in the Plume Airdrop is
            _____. All other websites are fraudulent and we are not responsible
            for any consequences of engaging with such websites.
            <br />
            <br /> <b>11.3 Tax and Regulatory Risks.</b> Without limiting the
            foregoing, you understand that there may be tax and regulatory risks
            related to participating in the Airdrop. It is your sole
            responsibility to determine whether, and to what extent, any taxes
            apply to any transactions you conduct in connection with your
            participation, and to withhold, collect, report, and remit the
            correct amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. Digital
            assets, blockchain technology, and any related software and services
            are also subject to legal and regulatory uncertainty. You understand
            that legislative and regulatory changes or actions may adversely
            affect the usage, transferability, transactability, and
            accessibility of digital assets, bridging, the protocol, or other
            parts of the Service. To the extent licenses, permits, or other
            authorizations are required in one or more jurisdictions in which
            the Plume Network is deemed to operate, there is no guarantee that
            the Foundation or another party will be able to secure such
            licenses, permits, or authorizations in order to operate.
            Significant changes may need to be made to the Plume Network to
            comply with any licensing and/or registration requirements (or any
            other legal or regulatory requirements) in order to avoid violating
            applicable laws or regulations or because of the cost of such
            compliance. Uncertainty in how the legal and regulatory environment
            will develop could negatively impact the development, growth, and
            utilization of the Plume Network and therefore the uses of Tokens.
            <br />
            <br /> <b>11.4 Cyberattacks and Security Breaches.</b> You
            understand that cyberattacks and security breaches of the Plume
            Network, or the smart contracts controlling the Airdrop, or any
            front- end user interface or application related to or impacting the
            Plume Network, can occur and could cause you to lose Tokens, or
            adversely impact the Plume Network or Tokens.
            <br />
            <br /> <b>11.5 Utilization Risks.</b> The Airdrop Tokens are
            designed to be utilised in the Plume Network. There can be no
            assurance that the Tokens or the Plume Network will function as
            intended or as described on any website or in other communications
            or will be maintained and further developed according to current
            plans.
            <br />
            <br /> <b>11.6 Lack of Market.</b> There is no public market for the
            Tokens, and we do not control the development of such a market. A
            public market may not develop or be sustainable, and you may not be
            able to sell your Tokens. Furthermore, we cannot control how Token
            holders or third-party exchanges or platforms may support Tokens, if
            at all. Even if a public market for Tokens develops, such a market
            may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory
            oversight, making it more susceptible to fraud or manipulation.
            Further, the transfer restrictions on Tokens will remain in place
            for a significant period of time. Even if a public market does
            eventually exist, you may not be able to freely sell or transfer
            your Tokens. If you can freely sell your tokens in a public market
            after some period of time, the depth and volume in that market may
            be insufficient for you to sell without substantial price
            concessions.
            <br />
            <br /> <b>12. Privacy and Data Protection</b>
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>12.1</b> We may collect, use, and store limited personal
            information as necessary for verifying eligibility and distributing
            Tokens. We will handle all personal data in accordance with
            applicable privacy laws and our Privacy Policy (if applicable).
            <br />
            <br /> <b>12.2</b>
            By participating in the Airdrop, you consent to the collection and
            use of your data as described in these Terms.
            <br />
            <br /> <b>13. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</b>
            <br />
            <br /> <b>13.1 Governing Law:</b> These Terms and any dispute
            arising out of or related to the Terms or the Airdrop will be
            governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Cayman
            Islands without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
            <br />
            <br /> <b>13.2 Exclusive Arbitration:</b> Any dispute arising out of
            or related to these Terms, as well as any issue on its validity and
            existence, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration
            administered by the Cayman International Mediation and Arbitration
            Centre (CI-MAC) in accordance with the CI-MAC Rules for the time
            being in force. The seat of the arbitration shall be the Cayman
            Islands. The Tribunal shall consist of one (1) arbitrator, appointed
            by the Foundation. The language of the arbitration shall be English.
            You hereby waive all rights to participate in any class action
            lawsuit or class wide arbitration against the Foundation or any
            Foundation Person.
            <br />
            <br /> <b>13.3 Non-Waiver:</b> Our failure to exercise or enforce
            any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver
            of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found
